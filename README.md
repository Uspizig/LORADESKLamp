 WARNINGS
 1. Before you compile please ensure you modify all your credentials and used sensors in "credentials.h" which have been marked REPLACEMEUSER
 2. USE a Proper POWER SOURCE with at exactly 5 Volt(NOT 6V, not 4V)DC Voltage / The Power Supply should be capable of handling at least/minimum of 2 Ampere output
 3. To give You some more safety I set the default Amount of LEDS in the credentials.h to 6. 
 4. If you want to use more LEDS and have enough Power change ANZAHL_LEDS to 36

/*
Goal:
Project Goal Build a Desktop Lamp that can measure the Air Quality and warn the user if certain levels are reached.


What is working:
 - Update with OTA over Wifi
 - Switch on the upper LED under the rotary encoder
 - Switch on the lower LED
 - Detect a turn of the LED with the MPU9250 Gyro
 - Measure Temperature with the BMP280
 - Measure Brghtness with the LDR 
 - Wifi connectivity
 - Publish and recieve Data over MQTT
 - Measure eCo2, TVOC Data from BME680
 - Gyro Calibration on startup
 - Code is working with SK6812 Diodes and WS2812

Where to improve:
- Action performed on Gyro Measurements
- FailSafe methods if Wifi or MQTT Server becomes unavailible

Things that needs to be implemented:
 - AdvANCED Methods that are performed whenever the lamp is turned
 - Current measurement to protect about over current and detect shortcuts to GND
 - Change or enable Light when AirQuality becomes over a specific value
 - Update all warning limits of the sensors(Temp, CO2, Humidity,Light ..)  over MQTT
 - Update Wifi Credentials, MQTT Server over Wifi
 - Integrate Demo Lora Sketch to this source
 - NTP:Current Time
 - Quiet Time: Times when the Dekslamp shall go to sleep
 - Adaptaions vor PVB V2 to disable quiscent current of each LED during off Phase
 - Low Power Mode(Sleep Mode of all sensors)
 - Ultra Low Power Mode: Let the Processor sleep


Basic Operation:
- Switch On the Desklamp with a Button PRESS [OK]
- Change Brightness or collor by rotating the knob [OK]
- Nice LED by LED Dimming for nice shutdown of the light[OK}

Advanced:
- Save the most used Brightness level by Longpress the button (5 Sec) [not yet implemented]
- Set the color temperature[Partly OK]
- Measure the Temperature/Humidity/CO2/Brightness[OK]
- Aktivate a Timer Function . Lamp Blinks once the timer has been reached: Aktivate by Turn the lamp head to 90Â° [Not yet implemented]
- Set the Color via MQTT[OK]

Advanced Phase 2:
- Set the Timerlength via MQTT [Not done yet]
- Detect Bluetooth Devices[needs to be merged to this sketch]
- Transmit Data over LORA [OK but needs to be merged to this sketch]

  LORA:
  - Trasnmit Data if LED is switched ON/OFF= PORT1
  - Transmit detected Bluetooth Devices, Transmit detected Users with Corona Warn APP = PORT2
  - Transmit Air Quality Sensors = PORT3
